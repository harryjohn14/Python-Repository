"""
I dont think I got the second part of this code.
I have been having challenges figuring out how to reject data that are already
in my list using conditional statements.

I need help to continue.

"""


myUniqueList = []

myUniqueList.append (1)
myUniqueList.append (3)
myUniqueList.append (5)
myUniqueList.append (7)
myUniqueList.append (9)
print(myUniqueList) 

"""
myUniqueList.append (11)
print(myUniqueList)
newList = myUniqueList
print(newList)

if newList.append (0) <= newlist:
    newlist = newlist
print(newList)
